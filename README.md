# Python

| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Food Hub Data Analysis](https://github.com/jgabrielg99/Python/blob/main/FoodHub%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb) | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) | Analyzed customer order data for FoodHub, a New York-based food delivery app, to identify trends in restaurant demand and customer behavior. Used Python and data visualization tools to uncover insights that support strategic decisions for improving service and operations. | Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| [AllLife Bank Personal Loan Campaign](https://github.com/jgabrielg99/Python/blob/main/AllLife%20Bank%20Personal%20Loan%20Campaign.ipynb) | EDA, Machine Learning, Classification Models | Built a predictive model for AllLife Bank to identify liability customers likely to purchase personal loans. Analyzed key customer attributes to improve targeting for future marketing campaigns and boost loan conversion rates. | Decision Tree, GridSearchCV, Scikit-Learn |
| [Thera Bank Credit Card Churn Prediction](https://github.com/jgabrielg99/Python/blob/main/Thera%20Bank%20Credit%20Card%20Churn%20Prediction.ipynb) | EDA, Machine Learning, Classification Models | Developed a classification model for Thera Bank to predict which customers are likely to stop using their credit cards. Analyzed customer data to uncover key factors driving attrition and provided insights to help improve retention strategies. | SMOTE, RandomUnderSampler, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, XGB Classifier |
| [Kaggle Bank Churn Prediction](https://github.com/jgabrielg99/Python/blob/main/Bank%20Churn%20Prediction%20Neural%20Network.ipynb) | Deep Learning, Neural Networks | Built a neural network classifier to predict customer churn for a bank, aiming to identify customers likely to leave within the next six months. Provided insights into key service factors influencing churn to support targeted retention efforts. | Tensorflow, Keras, SGD Optimizer, Adam Optimizer |
| [Computer Vision: Plant Seedling Classification](https://github.com/jgabrielg99/Python/blob/main/Plant%20Seedlings%20Classification.ipynb) | Computer Vision, Convolutional Neural Networks | Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plant seedlings, aiming to automate plant identification and reduce manual labor in agriculture. The model enhances efficiency and supports sustainable practices by improving crop management and decision-making. | CV2, Tensorflow, Keras |

# SQL
| Project Link | Area of Analysis | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|
| [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://github.com/jgabrielg99/8-Week-SQL-Challenge) | Data analysis, data cleaning, data transformation | This project is a deep-dive into real-world SQL analytics, based on the [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com) by Data With Danny. This challenge highlights strong SQL fundamentals, complex joins, CTEs, window functions, and subqueries. It demonstrates my ability to extract actionable insights from relational databases in diverse business contexts. | 

# Tableau
| Dashboard Link | Project Description | 
|---|---|
| [Sales and Customer Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/gabriel.grant7325/viz/SalesDashboard_17467301138370/SalesDashboard) | This project features an interactive Tableau dashboard with two views: Sales and Customer. The Sales Dashboard displays KPIs for Total Sales, Profit, and Quantity, along with year-over-year comparisons through line and bar charts. Users can filter data by year and interact directly with charts to explore trends. The Customer Dashboard includes KPIs for Total Customers, Sales per Customer, and Total Orders, plus visualizations for order distribution and the top 10 customers by profit. |
